        I'm sorry for hurting you and I hope you'll stop hurting me. I love you and won't leave you. I stayed up all night to show you how much I love you.<br><br>
        If I say I don't expect anything in return, I would be lying, so in return I expect something lovey-dovey, effortful, and meaningful from you.<br><br>
        I love you anyways.<br><br>
        PS: Don't think I'm materialistic. I just wanna see the best you can do when you really wanna show your love. Cuz for these 2 years I don't think I've received it nor you've shown it. I guess I'm eligible to receive your true love?<br><br>
        I love you, darl.

        Now go and say Ahmadh that you're truly sorry for hurting him and don't tell him what you're doing in return. But do mention the date when it will be done by.<br><br>Good girl. Go love Ahmadh.
